👋 Welcome to My Blog!

Hi there! I’m Dharma, a curious mind with a passion for learning and sharing knowledge. This is my little corner of the internet where I explore ideas, build projects from scratch, and document my journey one post at a time.

Here, you’ll find tutorials, “Today I Learned” posts, and plenty of coding experiments—whether it's about AI, deep learning, or anything else that sparks curiosity. My goal is to break down concepts, share insights, and make learning fun for everyone.

Thanks for stopping by, and let’s learn and grow together! 🚀✨
